Virtual Data Science Internship with Bharat Intern

Titanic Classification
For this project, I've designed a robust classification model to predict the survival status of passengers on the Titanic using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers. By meticulously analyzing the dataset and evaluating model performance, I've gained valuable insights into the effectiveness of different algorithms for this specific classification task.

You can explore the code, data, and results of both projects. They are valuable resources for anyone interested in stock price prediction and classification tasks. These projects provide a hands-on experience with real-world datasets and machine learning techniques.

I hope you find these projects insightful and inspiring. Don't hesitate to provide feedback or suggestions for further improvements. Happy exploring and learning!
