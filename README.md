Virtual Data Science Internship with Bharat Intern

Task-1:
Titanic Classification:

For this project, I've designed a robust classification model to predict the survival status of passengers on the Titanic using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers. By meticulously analyzing the dataset and evaluating model performance, I've gained valuable insights into the effectiveness of different algorithms for this specific classification task.


Task -2:
Number Recognition - In this task I have to perform Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST Dataset with the help of Neural Network.Handwritten digit recognition system not only detects
scanned images of handwritten digits.Handwritten digit recognition using MNIST dataset is a major project made with the help of Neural Network. It basically detects the scanned images of handwritten digits.
