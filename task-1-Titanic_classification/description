Task-1: Titanic Classification:

For this project, I've designed a robust classification model to predict the survival status of passengers on the Titanic using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers.
By meticulously analyzing the dataset and evaluating model performance, I've gained valuable insights into the effectiveness of different algorithms for this specific classification task.
